# RTM — Derived Exposure Priors

This directory contains **derived, building-level exposure features**
for the Rotterdam (RTM) study area.

These datasets are **deterministic spatial metrics** derived from
normalized and clipped geospatial layers.
They are intended to be used as **inputs or priors** in probabilistic models,
not as hazard probabilities.

## Interpretation constraints

- These features **do not represent flood probability**
- No hydraulic or temporal modeling is included
- Values are not directly comparable across cities without rescaling
